Microbiome Analysis

This repository is a selected collection of jupyter notebooks and Python scripts intended to serve as a gateway into genomic data science.
The code was written following Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook - Third Edition by Tiago Antao https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/bioinformatics-with-python/9781803236421/

Code is followed closely, however, dependencies have later versions. conda environment was created using the Yaml file found in this repository. Other differences are shorter lines for readability and variables with different names.
